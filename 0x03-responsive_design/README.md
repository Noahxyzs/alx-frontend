Responsive design is an approach in web development that makes web pages render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. It's about creating web pages that look good on all devices, whether it's a desktop, tablet, or phone¹².

Here are some key elements of responsive design:

1. **Setting the Viewport**: This involves adding a `<meta>` tag to all your web pages. This tag gives the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling¹. For example:
```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
```

2. **Responsive Images**: These are images that scale nicely to fit any browser size. You can make an image responsive by setting its width to 100%¹. For example:
```html
<img src="img_girl.jpg" style="width:100%;">
```
Or, you can use the `max-width` property to ensure the image never scales up to be larger than its original size¹. For example:
```html
<img src="img_girl.jpg" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;">
```

3. **Media Queries**: These allow you to define completely different styles for different browser sizes¹². For example, you can have three `div` elements display horizontally on large screens and stack vertically on small screens.

4. **Responsive Text Size**: The text size can be set with a "vw" unit, which means the "viewport width". That way the text size will follow the size of the browser window¹.

Remember, responsive design isn't a separate technology — it's an approach or a set of best practices used to create a layout that can respond to any device being used to view the content².
